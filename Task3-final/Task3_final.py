    It is a helper function that we used to check against errors since the data has errors such as:
    - empty strings instead of customer IDs.
    - omitted fields ("cells") that causes incorrect indexing which causes errors
      while calculating revenues "price*quantity".
    It tries to:
    - convert customer_id into integer type. If it was not able to (ex: in case customer_id=' '),
       then an error will be raised.
    - convert price and quantity into float. If it was not able to (ex: in case incorrect indexing
        due to omitted values which causes price and quantity to have unconvertible values),
        then an error will be raised.

    In case an error or errors have been raised due to what is mentioned above,
     the function will return a string says "THIS ROW HAS AN ERROR"
    Otherwise "if everything goes well in try block", it returns the pair (customer_ID, (price , quantity))
    @:param "row": a record of our data (as a list of its fields)
